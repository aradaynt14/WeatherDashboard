## Weather Dashboard

Our Group chose to create a weather dashboard as the topic for our group presentation. We are using the openweathermap api.

### Features

<ul>
<li>You are able to look up any city and the website will display the current weather and 5 day forecast, along with some graphs</li>
<li>You can click the "Select a Date for Historical Weather" button and select a day within the last year using the calendar that appears. This will show you the weather of that day at 8am, noon, 5pm, and 9pm. You can remove this data with the "Clear Historical Data" button.</li>
</ul>

### Requirements
